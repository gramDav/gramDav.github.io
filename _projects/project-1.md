This 2-axis rotary table is developed for integration into a multi-axis CNC milling machine. It was designed, manufactured and assembled by me, using a variety of custom machined parts and off-the-shelf components. Primary goals were to machine non-ferrous metals and plastics using 3+2 style and full 5-axis machining techniques. I have begun designing and building a full 5-axis CNC milling machine that will eventually use this rotary table. The mill structure is similar to a bridge mill, where the y-axis and rotary axes travels underneath the x-axis and mill spindle, as shown below.

This project provided many opportunities to learn more about machine design, electronics, programming, motor and gearbox sizing, servo tuning, pneumatics, fabrication and systems integration.

# Design

This 2-axis tilting rotary table is designed to be compact and stiff (both moment stiffness and torsional stiffness). Primary components include:

1. Large diameter needle roller thrust bearings
2. Oversized crossed roller bearings
3. Harmonic drives (strain wave gear reducers)
4. AC servo motors with absolute shaft encoders
5. Trunnion style support bearing arrangement
6. Pneumatic brake for clamping

Shown below are several section views showing internal components and design elements:

## C-Axis Pneumatic Brake

![Two-axis rotary table brake](/images/2 Axis Trunnion Brake Explode_w600.jpg)

*Exploded view of rotary table brake components*

For simplicity and cost reasons I used brake pads commonly found in hydraulic mountain bike brake. Seven of these pads are mounted to the drive pulley of the spindle. A stainless steel brake rotor is mounted to an axially compliant but torsionally stiff [flexure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexure). When air is applied the piston clamps the rotor, the rotor shifts axially and clamps against the brake pads and drive pulley, locking the rotary table. A wave spring provides a returning force to unclamp the brake when air is removed from the system. This brake design provides stiff and backlash-free clamping of the rotary table due to the unique brake rotor flexure design. The rotary table can be clamped with up to 115 Nm of brake torque @ 100 psi (depends on air pressure).

*FEA result showing axial deflection with 1 N total applied force. In this case, axial stiffness is 1 N / deflection. Deflection = 2.8 µm, Stiffness = 0.36 N/µm*

*FEA result showing torsional deflection with 1 Nm total applied torque. In this case, torsional stiffness is 1 Nm / angular deflection at R = 55 mm. Linear Deflection = 8.27 µm, Angular Deflection = 0.0085 **°**, Angular Stiffness = 118 Nm/**°** [6771 Nm/rad]*

## Compact C-Axis Motor and Drivetrain

I wanted to have the C-axis motor and drivetrain tucked inside the body of the rotary table to shield it from metal chips and coolant. The largest motor I could package in the structure was a 200W servo motor. This motor is directly coupled to a 17-80 harmonic drive, with an 80:1 reduction. The powerful motor enables rotation speeds of up to 40 RPM [240 deg/s], with a peak output torque of 220 Nm. All of the motor, encoder, home sensor wiring and pneumatics are protected in the aluminum housing.

## High Torque A-Axis Servo Motor and Harmonic Drive

The A-axis uses a rebuilt [SHF-40-100-2UH](https://www.harmonicdrive.net/products/gear-units/hollow-shaft-gear-units/shf-2uh/shf-40-100-2uh) harmonic drive from Harmonic Drive Solutions. This gear reducer also includes a very stiff preloaded crossed roller bearing to support any radial, axial or moment loads. Harmonic drives operate with very little angular backlash (< 7 arc sec [0.002 degrees]), hysteresis and excellent positional accuracy (1 arc min [0.0166 degrees]) - making them a great option for this rotary table. They offer a large gear reduction in a very small package with great mechanical efficiency and torsional stiffness. This particular unit is 100:1, with a rated torque of 265 Nm and excellent rigidity. I was able to get this unit from a machine rebuilder on Ebay for a great price, along with a replacement crossed roller bearing from a Taiwan supplier.
