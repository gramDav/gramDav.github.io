###### Ingredients

**Buns**

- 2 tbsp active dry yeast
- 1 cup + 2 tbsp warm water about 110 degrees
- 1/3 cup melted butter (or olive/avocado oil)
- 1/4 cup sugar or honey
- 1 large egg beaten
- 1 tsp salt
- 3 to 3-1/2 cups all-purpose flour

**Topping**

- 1 egg yolk
- 1 tbsp water
- 2 tbsp sesame seeds


###### Instructions

1. Add yeast and warm water to a large bowl. Add butter/oil and sugar; let stand for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, mixture should be foamy.
2. Whisk in egg. Slowly mix in the salt and flour. Continue to add flour until you have a soft dough.
3. Using a dough hook, knead in a mixer for 3-5 minutes, until dough is smooth and elastic. (If you donâ€™t want to use a mixer, you can knead by hand on a lightly floured surface.) Do not let rise. 
4. Divide into 8 equal pieces; shape each into a ball. Do not let the dough rise.
5. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Place the dough balls on a greased or lin. Cover with a kitchen towel and let rest for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes add the egg wash, then sprinkle with sesame seeds.
6. Bake at 425 for 15 minutes, or until golden brown!
7. Store buns in an airtight container for up to 2 days. Or, freeze for up to one month.
