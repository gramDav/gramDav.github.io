- 2 ounces thinly sliced pepperoni

#### Instructions:

###### **Make the dough:**

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and instant yeast. Add the water. Using a rubber spatula, mix until the water is absorbed and the ingredients form a sticky dough ball. Slick the dough with a teaspoon of olive oil. Cover the bowl with an airtight lid. Let rise overnight or for 10 to 12 hours at room temperature.
2. Using lightly oiled hands or a flexible bowl scraper, deflate the dough by releasing it from the sides of the bowl and pulling it towards the center. Shape it into a rough ball.
3. Transfer the dough to a lidded storage vessel, then transfer to the fridge for 1 to 2 days. **Note: If you need to shorten this time line, you can skip the fridge rise altogether; if you need to lengthen it, the dough can last in the fridge for up to a week but with less reliable results.** 

###### **Prepare the pan and dough for baking:**

1. Grease the pan with the tablespoon of softened butter — I have stopped greasing the sides of the pan and only grease the bottom to help the dough hold its shape during the parbake. Pour 1 teaspoon of olive oil into the center.
2. Remove the dough from the fridge, deflate it, then immediately stretch it to fit the pan. Cover the dough with plastic wrap, then let rise for 3 to 5 hours depending on the time of year and the temperature of your kitchen. **Note: If you hate plastic wrap, you can use parchment paper (press it right up against the surface of the dough) though it doesn’t work quite as well. You can also cover the pan with beeswax wrap**.

###### **Parbake the dough:**

1. Preheat the oven to 500ºF with a rack in the center of your oven. If you have a Baking Steel or pizza stone, place it on the rack while it preheats.
2. Dimple the dough one last time with lightly oiled hands taking care not to dimple the perimeter. Transfer the pan to the oven for 8 minutes.
3. Remove the pan from the oven and carefully transfer the dough to a cooling rack. Let it cool upside down on the rack for 20 minutes. Do not wash the pan.
4. Once the dough is cooled, you can transfer it to an airtight storage bag for 1 to 2 days at room temperature or up to 3 months in the freezer.

###### **Top the pizza:**

1. Preheat the oven to 475ºF.
2. Return the parbaked crust to its pan (bottom side down).
3. Combine the two pre-shredded cheeses for the frico crust in a medium bowl. Combine the onions and peppers in a separate bowl.
4.  Spread the grated cheese mixture around the perimeter of the dough pressing it into the sides of the pan.
5. Sprinkle the hand-grated mozzarella over the interior surface of the dough.
6. Drop spoonfuls of the sauce over the cheese, then use the back of a spoon to distribute it. Spread the onions and peppers over the sauce. Spread the pepperoni evenly over the top.

###### **Bake the pizza:**

1. Transfer the pizza to the oven for 10 minutes or until the edges are caramelized to your liking. Remove the pan from the oven and let the pizza rest for 2 minutes in the pan. Carefully run a paring knife or spatula around the pan’s edges. Then, carefully remove the entire pizza from the pan, transferring it to a cutting board. Cut the pizza into 8 to 10 pieces and serve.



###### **Extra Notes:**

As always, for best results, use a [digital scale](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004164SRA/ref%3Das_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie%3DUTF8%26tag%3Dalexandrask06-20%26creative%3D9325%26linkCode%3Das2%26creativeASIN%3DB004164SRA%26linkId%3D7706464bfaf0ee6383ab6cb7c7809f80%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1708385133386069%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw1_QqP-9Dl9ykiZrzROfPos&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1708385133404526&usg=AOvVaw1c6xey7Y7u1DNMccCiORNk) to measure. If you’re looking for a sourdough version, find it [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://alexandracooks.com/2021/08/13/detroit-style-pizza-two-ways-yeast-and-sourdough/%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1708385133386507%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw3UK5j-JDknM_sI9vxXtDHU&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1708385133404721&usg=AOvVaw0Klk35foR1QVQkrBVloOrJ).

The Pan: This [Lloyd Detroit-style pan](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FY5PHIK/ref%3Das_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie%3DUTF8%26tag%3Dalexandrask06-20%26creative%3D9325%26linkCode%3Das2%26creativeASIN%3DB01FY5PHIK%26linkId%3Dc5c64587fbe5ef108ee595776527e03f%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1708385133387068%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw0YzxJjC_z4-EQ9TGM_PrOH&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1708385133404835&usg=AOvVaw052UpMVOr1qIYpaZAMOdsQ) is fantastic (also a little pricey, but definitely worth it).

Yeast: I love [SAF instant yeast](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00V7F5OPI/ref%3Das_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie%3DUTF8%26tag%3Dalexandrask06-20%26creative%3D9325%26linkCode%3Das2%26creativeASIN%3DB00V7F5OPI%26linkId%3D2aad5482d3651f965ddd831c0adadfd0%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1708385133387632%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw3qaV7qJNOoUMiMfmopFfk4&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1708385133404971&usg=AOvVaw1pEqZFjAkJ9x8EKzLWgD9q). I buy it in bulk, transfer it to a [quart storage container](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00M9Z4SV6/ref%3Das_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie%3DUTF8%26tag%3Dalexandrask06-20%26creative%3D9325%26linkCode%3Das2%26creativeASIN%3DB00M9Z4SV6%26linkId%3Dae2ae7d822efa6438887d439ac6b9915%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1708385133388013%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw24imOmdP-scYbFoHGs6hrQ&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1708385133405113&usg=AOvVaw2TKJnWbiEILXFEWjCrru5-), and store it in my fridge for months. If you are using active-dry yeast, simply sprinkle the yeast over the lukewarm water and let it stand for 15 minutes or until it gets foamy; then proceed with the recipe. If you need to push the rise even longer, you can use ¼ teaspoon or 1 gram of instant yeast.

Flour: Bread flour is preferable here, but all-purpose flour works, too. I always use King Arthur.

Salt: If you are using Morton kosher salt, use half as much by volume or the same amount by weight.

Cheese: In the video, I used 6 ounces of cheese for the frico crust, but you can use 7 or 8 ounces if you want an even taller, more dramatic crust. I find 6 ounces to be sufficient. For the frico crust, pre-grated cheese is recommended: I like the Cabot Double Cheddar for the cheddar and various brands (Cabot, Sargento, Galbani) of pre-grated whole milk low-moisture mozzarella for the mozzarella.

Toppings: I am using [Mama Lil’s](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://mamalils.com/collections/frontpage/products/mildly-spicy-peppers-in-oil-original-12oz-6-pack?variant%3D14286011301933%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1708385133389041%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw3m6_V-jm7pjbLLPV-ePAax&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1708385133405372&usg=AOvVaw1kqdJgNe6s1Pw0RlIk7pav), but pickled hot cherry peppers, which are more readily available can be used here.
